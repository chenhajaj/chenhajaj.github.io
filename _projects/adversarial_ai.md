# Adversarial Artificial Intelligence Research

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become ubiquitous in modern society, but traditional AI approaches often overlook adversarial scenarios where malicious actors seek to exploit system vulnerabilities. Our research focuses on developing robust AI systems that can withstand sophisticated attacks while maintaining performance and reliability.

## Research Overview

Our work addresses the fundamental challenges in adversarial AI, where system designers must anticipate and defend against malicious adversaries who aim to compromise both the system and its users. We combine theoretical foundations with practical implementations to create more secure AI systems.

## Research Areas

### 1. Attack Detection & Prevention
- Advanced threat detection algorithms for encrypted traffic analysis
- Real-time attack prevention mechanisms in network security
- Proactive vulnerability assessment in mobile systems
- Zero-day attack detection frameworks

### 2. Robust AI System Design
- Architecture-level security considerations for healthcare AI
- Adversarial training methodologies for social networks
- System hardening techniques for mobile applications
- Privacy-preserving machine learning implementations

### 3. Security Evaluation Frameworks
- Comprehensive testing protocols for malware detection
- Performance-security trade-off analysis in real-time systems
- Benchmark development for encrypted traffic classification
- Evaluation metrics for adversarial attack resilience

### 4. Real-time Defense Mechanisms
- Dynamic response systems for network security
- Adaptive security measures for mobile platforms
- Continuous monitoring solutions for healthcare AI
- Real-time threat mitigation in social networks

## Impact & Results
