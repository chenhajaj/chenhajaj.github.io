# Incentive Design Research

My research focuses on the economics of decision-making in networks and incentives in crowdsourcing. I investigate how to design effective payment schemes and task allocation strategies to maximize participant effort in crowdsourcing platforms.

## Research Areas

Our work encompasses several key areas:
- Payment mechanism design
- Task allocation optimization  
- Network coordination and cooperation
- Team formation incentives
- Preference elicitation
- Social welfare maximization

## Challenges in Crowdsourcing

A key challenge in crowdsourcing is designing payment schemes that:
- Motivate high-quality work
- Ensure fair compensation
- Prevent gaming of the system
- Scale efficiently

## Team Formation Research

Our research on team formation investigates mechanisms to:
1. Elicit honest reporting of preferences and capabilities
2. Form effective teams that maximize social welfare
3. Balance individual and collective objectives
4. Promote fairness in team composition
