# Adversarial Artificial Intelligence Research

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become ubiquitous in modern society. However, traditional AI approaches fail to consider a crucial set of phenomena in which relationships are adversarial. Our research focuses on developing robust AI systems that can withstand malicious attacks.

## Project Overview

Adversarial AI centers around the clash between system designers and malicious adversaries who seek to harm both the designer and the users who consume their services. We investigate approaches to prevent and mitigate adversarial attacks on AI systems.

## Real-World Impact

The consequences of adversarial tampering can be severe:
- Disruption of smart home devices (e.g., Google Home)
- Navigation app manipulation with false traffic updates
- Recommender system exploitation for misinformation
- Security system vulnerabilities in critical infrastructure

Our research aims to prevent these scenarios by developing robust and secure AI systems that can withstand malicious attacks. We focus on both theoretical foundations and practical implementations of defensive strategies.

## Research Areas

Our work encompasses several key areas:
1. Attack detection and prevention
2. Robust AI system design
3. Security evaluation frameworks
4. Real-time defense mechanisms

The code implementations and experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in AI system security while maintaining performance and usability.
